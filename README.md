# Hi, I'm Sofia 

Computer Engineering student @ **Politecnico di Milano** — passionate about math, algorithms and building things that actually work.

I thrive in high-pressure, creative environments. Hackathons are my favourite place to be: the tighter the deadline, the better I think. I'm always looking for the next challenge to step outside my comfort zone.
